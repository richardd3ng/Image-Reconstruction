# Brain Computer Interface Movement Decoding

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI's) are a relatively new technology that presents significant potential to help individuals who lose the ability to perform normal motor functions. If imagined movemenents from neural signals can be effectively translated into the true intent of the movement, BCI's can enable individuals to perform physical movements by simply imagining them. This project explores the applications of Support Vector Machines to distinguish between left-handed and right-handed movement using brain electrode signals as features.
